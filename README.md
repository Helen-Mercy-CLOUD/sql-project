Sales Management System – Project Introduction

**Introduction**

  The Sales Management System is a relational database project developed using MySQL that helps manage customers, products, orders, and sales transactions efficiently. It is designed to simulate a real-world retail or e-commerce backend system where businesses need to track inventory, customer purchases, and revenue.

In this project, the database named sales_management maintains structured data across multiple related tables such as:

Customers – Stores customer details

Products – Maintains product information and stock

Orders – Records customer purchase orders

Order Details – Stores product-wise order information

The system uses Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to maintain relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

**Purpose of the Project**

    The main objective of this project is to:
    
    Organize sales-related data in a structured format
    
    Maintain relationships between customers and their orders
    
    Track product inventory automatically
    
    Generate meaningful sales reports using SQL queries

Demonstrate advanced database concepts like:

    Joins
    
    Aggregate Functions
    
    Subqueries
    
    Views
    
    Stored Procedures
    
    Triggers

**Real-World Application**

**This system can be used in:**

    Retail Shops
    
    E-commerce Platforms
    
    Wholesale Businesses
    
    Inventory Management Systems
    
    It helps businesses monitor:
    
    Total sales revenue
    
    Category-wise sales
    
    Customer purchase history
    
    Product stock availability

**Technologies Used**

    MySQL – Database Management System
    
    SQL (DDL, DML, DQL) – For creating and managing data

**What is WHERE in SQL?**

    The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records from a table based on a specific condition.
    
    It allows you to retrieve only the data that meets certain criteria instead of displaying all records.
**
Create Database**

CREATE DATABASE sales_management;
 USE sales_management;
 
**Customers Table**

              CREATE TABLE customers (
              customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
              customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
              email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
              city VARCHAR(50)
              );

**Products Table**
        
            CREATE TABLE products (
            product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            category VARCHAR(50),
            price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
            stock INT DEFAULT 0
            );
**
Orders Table**

            CREATE TABLE orders (
            order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            customer_id INT,
            order_date DATE,
            FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
                ON DELETE CASCADE
                ON UPDATE CASCADE
            );

  **Order Details Table**

          CREATE TABLE order_details (
          order_detail_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
          order_id INT,
          product_id INT,
          quantity INT NOT NULL,
          FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
              ON DELETE CASCADE
              ON UPDATE CASCADE,
          FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
              ON DELETE CASCADE
              ON UPDATE CASCADE
          );

What is a Schema in Database**?**

A schema in a database is the structure or blueprint of how the data is organized.

It defines:

Tables

Columns

Data types

Relationships

Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, etc.)

**Types of Schema**
**Database Schema**

Overall design of the database (all tables and relationships).

**Table Schema**

Structure of a single table.
