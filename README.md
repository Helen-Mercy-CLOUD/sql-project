Sales Management System – Project Introduction

**Introduction**

  The Sales Management System is a relational database project developed using MySQL that helps manage customers, products, orders, and sales transactions efficiently. It is designed to simulate a real-world retail or e-commerce backend system where businesses need to track inventory, customer purchases, and revenue.

In this project, the database named sales_management maintains structured data across multiple related tables such as:

Customers – Stores customer details

Products – Maintains product information and stock

Orders – Records customer purchase orders

Order Details – Stores product-wise order information

The system uses Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to maintain relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

**Purpose of the Project**

    The main objective of this project is to:
    
    Organize sales-related data in a structured format
    
    Maintain relationships between customers and their orders
    
    Track product inventory automatically
    
    Generate meaningful sales reports using SQL queries

Demonstrate advanced database concepts like:

    Joins
    
    Aggregate Functions
    
    Subqueries
    
    Views
    
    Stored Procedures
    
    Triggers

**Real-World Application**

**This system can be used in:**

    Retail Shops
    
    E-commerce Platforms
    
    Wholesale Businesses
    
    Inventory Management Systems
    
    It helps businesses monitor:
    
    Total sales revenue
    
    Category-wise sales
    
    Customer purchase history
    
    Product stock availability

**Technologies Used**

    MySQL – Database Management System
    
    SQL (DDL, DML, DQL) – For creating and managing data

**What is WHERE in SQL?**

    The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records from a table based on a specific condition.
    
    It allows you to retrieve only the data that meets certain criteria instead of displaying all records.
